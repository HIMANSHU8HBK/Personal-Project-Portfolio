Statistical Analysis of Regional OTTs

Idea Initiation for the Research
In the beginning of the course, when the group was instructed to work on a group project as part of the course evaluation components, the group came up the idea of three different topics to work on. These are as follows:
•	To understand the buying pattern of rural Indians through e-commerce sites
•	To study the perception of viewers towards regional content on OTT platforms
•	To understand the buying behaviour of investors in mutual funds
Finally, the idea that was finalized for the research was the second topic - to study the perception of viewers towards regional content on OTT platforms. This was primarily because, the group members were ethnically diverse – five members had the following mother tongues – Punjabi, Odia, Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. 
The group members had personally witnessed the growth of regional OTT platforms in recent times, had personal experiences of watching content on these platforms and was of the idea with cheap prices and constant penetration of internet across the country, there remains a tremendous in terms of marketing and growth of these platforms. 
There were also certain apprehensions as to how many people were knowledgeable about several regional OTT platforms, and actually subscribed and watched content in them in the light of overarching and dominating international and Hindi platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Hotstar, Zee 5, Sony Liv, Voot, Alt Balaji etc. in India. So, the group decided to study the perception of viewers towards regional content on OTT platforms. 
In the beginning of the study, the group was instructed to undertake the following tasks:
•	To review the literature on the selected topic
•	To conduct unstructured interviews as a pilot survey, to identify the variables


Conceptualization of the Study
The literature review that the group studied comprised of journal articles, newspaper and industry reports and other secondary data sources. 
One particular report that stood out with respect to the idea of the study, was by FICCI and EY, published in March 2021, titled “Playing by New Rules: India’s Media and Entertainment Sector Reboots in 2020”. This report was widely covered in popular media, and found that regional content on OTT platforms was already 30 percent in 2019, and would surpass more than 50 percent by 2025, as compared to mainstream Hindi and international content (FICCI, 2021). 
Also, regional platforms such as Hoichoi (Bengali), Tarang Plus (Odia), Planet Marathi (Marathi) etc. were investing significantly to upgrade their platforms and bring local productions into fore. There was a rise in both in the number of newer regional platforms as well as the content they were producing.
The group conducted 12 unstructured qualitative interviews as part of a pilot survey, to understand the perception of viewers towards regional content on OTT platforms, to understand the feasibility of the idea of the study, and to identify the variables for the study. The interviews are presented in the appendix section. The insights obtained from these interviews are as follows: 
•	Regional content is more relatable and gives a glimpse of the local culture
•	Quality of content on regional OTT is an indication of progress in the state
•	Subscribers remain emotionally connected to OTT content in the mother tongue
•	Regional platforms have yet to gain traction in quality as compared to Hindi or international platforms
•	Lack of quality content in every genre, poor acting skills and adapted storylines on regional platforms




Objectives of the Study
Based on the insights obtained from the literature review and the qualitative interviews, the group went forward with implementing their idea into the research project with the following objectives:
1.	To examine the usage of OTT platforms with respect to demographic factors
•	Does the usage vary across age? 
•	Does the usage vary across gender? 
•	Does the usage vary across income?

•	To find the willingness to pay for subscriptions on annual basis 
3.	To study the perception of viewers towards usage of OTT platforms 
4.	To study the viewing pattern of viewers in mother tongue as well as regional language
