1.	Estimate the regression of brand preference on the ratings of nine attributes. Interpret the results.

2.	Carry out a chapter analysis of the nine attributes. Label the factors and interpret the results. Save the factors scores and use them as independent variables in running the regression of brand preference on attributes. Interpret all the results and also compare the regression results so obtained with the regression as obtained in question 1.

3.	Carry out a discriminant  analysis by grouping the brand preference into two groups using a score of one to four as low preference and five to seven as high preference. Use the ratings of attributes as independent variables.  Interpret the results.

4.	Carry out the above exercise (as given in question 3) by using a logic regression. Compare the results in two cases.

5.	Carry out a three groups discriminant analysis by redefining the preference variable as follows:

    (a)	The score of one to two may be regarded as low preference. 
    (b)	The score of three to five may be regarded as medium preference.
    (c)	The score of six to seven may be regarded as high preference.
