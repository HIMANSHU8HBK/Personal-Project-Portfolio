The National Basketball Association, or NBA, a professional basketball league
• We have 30 teams in the league
• We have 82 games for each team in each season

Objective: Predict the number of game wins a team will have in a particular season using its performance statistics in the previous season with Machine Learning Algorithms

Models:

• Linear Regression • Lasso Regression 
• Support Vector Machine Regression
• Random Forest Regression


Conclusion:
• Easy models like linear regression and lasso regression are preferred
• Features like Plus-Minus and Steals (positive), 3-Point Field Goal Percentage and Field Goal Percentage (negative) might be more considered when predicting game wins
• RMSE is still a bit high (slightly below 10), might due to poor features chosen
• Would try more feature engineering to find more valuable
features
